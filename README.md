# Sonar-Rock-Vs-Mine-Prediction
The project is bascially predicting the rock or mine. In the times of war, the mine where placed under the water, so to check the mine through sending a submarine and detecting it using sonar waves.
This is a complete basic project based on logistic regression as it is a binary classification problem.
